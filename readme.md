#DejaVú

Creation of a web platform for digital content.

DejaVú is the result of the first practice of the Full Stack Web Bootcamp VII Keepcoding edition.

It is not allowed libraries or frameworks. The goal is to build a web platform for series, movies ... using exclusively:

* HTML5
* CSS3

The page should be displayed in the current versions of the main browsers.

The page must also have good accessibility and be responsive:

A login page has been created

a home page with four categories (news, series, flims and favorites)

![page home] (/assets/img/readme-img/home-ipad2.png)

and a master page for each of the series:
